# Changelog

This file documents recent notable changes to this project. The format of this
file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.15.2]

### Added

- Added a `CryptocurrencyMiningPool` event with `dns` protocol.

### Changed

- Renamed `ExternalDDos` to `ExternalDdos` and `ExternalDDosFields` to
  `ExternalDdosFields` in line with the Rust API Guidelines. This change
  improves consistency with the way acronyms are capitalized in UpperCamelCase.
  According to the guidelines, acronyms and contractions of compound words are
  to be treated as one word. For example, use `Uuid` instead of `UUID`, `Usize`
  instead of `USize`, or `Stdin` instead of `StdIn`.

  Please note that this is a breaking change and you will need to update your
  code if you have been using the old naming convention. We apologise for any
  inconvenience this may cause, but we believe this change will bring greater
  consistency and readability to the codebase.
- Removed `src_port` field from `FtpBruteForce` and `LdapBruteForce` events.
  to align with the event fields provided by hog.
- Modified `LdapPlainText` fields to appropriate LDAP event fields from wrong
  fields. This changes require updates in dependent projects due to complete
  change of the fields.
- Modified `FtpBruteForce` by adding an `is_internal` field which is a boolean
  indicating whether it is internal or not.

## [0.15.1] - 2023-06-26

### Added

- Added more event objects with `conn`, `ftp`, `http`, `ldap`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Event::TorConnection` and `Event::DomainGenerationAlgorithm` in
  `Event::count_network`.
  - Adjusted the counting routine for `TorConnection` and
    `DomainGenerationAlgorithm` events to address an issue of overcounting
    destination IP addresses. Previously, the counter was incremented for each
    destination address regardless of whether the event matched the specified
    `locator` and `filter`. The logic has been updated so that now both source
    and destination addresses are only considered if the event matches the
    `locator` and `filter`. This change corrects the count by ensuring only
    relevant events are considered in the total tally.

## [0.15.0] - 2023-06-14

### Added

- Introduced a new database table 'TRUSTED_USER_AGENTS' for handling
  non-browser detections.
- Added the ability to recover from the latest valid backup file.
  - In case of data loss or system failure, the new recovery feature allows
    users to automatically restore the system using the latest valid backup
    file available.
  - The recovery process identifies the most recent backup file that is valid
    and consistent, ensuring the integrity of the recovered data.

### Changed

- Added a new flag, `flush`, to the backup functionality, allowing users to
  control whether the database should be flushed before initiating the backup
  process.
  - When the flush flag is set to true, the database will be flushed before
    initiating the backup. This ensures that all pending data is written to
    disk, minimizing the risk of data loss during the backup process.
  - When the flush flag is set to false (default), the database will not be
    flushed before the backup, allowing for faster backup operations. However,
    please note that there is a slight risk of potential data loss if there are
    pending writes that have not been committed at the time of backup.

- Modified the backup, `restore_from_latest_backup`, `restore_from_backup`, and
  `purge_old_backups` functions to require a mutable reference of the database.
  Exclusive access to the database directory and backup directory is necessary
  for consistency and integrity. This prevents potential conflicts or data
  corruption during these critical processes.
  - It is recommended to schedule these operations during maintenance windows
    or low-activity periods to minimize disruption to users and services.
  - Ensure that appropriate permissions are granted to the executing user or
    process to access and modify the database and backup directories.

- Changed the argument `store` from `&Arc<Store>` to `&Arc<RwLock<Store>>` for
  `create`, `schedule_periodic`, `restore`, and `list` functions to allow for
  concurrent read and exclusive write access to the store, enabling better
  thread safety and data consistency during these operations.

- Modified the `restore` function argument `backup_id` from `u32` to `Option<u32>`.
  - When `backup_id` is set to `Some(id)`, the function restores from the backup
    with the provided `id`.
  - When `backup_id` is set to `None`, the function restores from the latest
    available backup. Please note that if the latest backup is invalid,
    restoration will fail.
  - To recover from the latest valid backup, a new `recover` function is introduced.

- Changed the default path for storing state.db backup from "/backup/path/" to
  "/backup/path/state.db/". The new default path provides better clarity and
  specificity, making it easier for users to locate and manage the state.db
  backup file. This change ensures consistency and aligns with best practices
  for backup file naming and organization.

- Modified the backup process during migration to occur once before the
  migration starts and deleted after the entire process succeeds. Previously,
  the backup and deletion of the backup were performed for each migration step.
  With this update, the backup process occurs once before the migration starts,
  ensuring a consistent starting point for the migration process. After the
  migration process successfully completes, the backup is deleted to avoid
  unnecessary duplication of backup files and reduce storage usage. This
  approach ensures that the backup file represents the state of the database
  before the entire migration process, providing a reliable fallback option if
  needed. This optimization improves the efficiency of the migration process,
  especially in scenarios involving a large number of migration steps or
  extensive data transformations.

- The `migrate_0_6_to_0_7` method has been improved for increased performance
  and memory usage. Previously, this method would migrate all the outlier in
  database.

  The updated method now removes outlier that is not marked as saved. This change
  is expected to remove unnecessary outliers in the database.

## [0.14.1] - 2023-06-10

### Changed

- The `migrate_0_6_to_0_7` method has been improved for increased performance
  and memory usage. Previously, this method would first scan all outliers in
  the database, deserializing them into memory, and then traverse them again in
  reverse order to update each entry according to the new format of version
  0.7. This two-pass approach could be memory intensive for large databases.

  The updated method now directly traverses outliers in the database in reverse
  order and updates each entry in a single pass. This reduces the memory
  footprint and increases efficiency by removing the initial full scan of
  outliers. This change is expected to significantly improve the speed and
  memory consumption of migrations from version 0.6 to 0.7, especially for
  larger databases.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-06-08

### Changed

- Altered the model file naming convention: Files are now required to use the
.tmm extension. The format has changed from `{model_name}-{timestamp}` to
`{model_name}-{timestamp}.tmm`. This adjustment ensures consistency in model
file formats and enhances our file identification and management system.
- Updated the logging mechanism to include a message `Migrating database to
{version}` when a database migration starts. This change enhances the
visibility and traceability of our database migrations, aiding in system
maintenance and debugging efforts.

### Removed

- Removed `Database::update_agent_status` from the review-database. In prior
versions, this function was used when REview allowed agents to forward messages
from another agent not directly connected to REview. However, in the recent
architectural changes, all agents now directly connect to REview, rendering
this function obsolete. The removal of `Database::update_agent_status`
simplifies the overall architecture and eliminates unnecessary function calls,
leading to a more streamlined system.

## [0.13.2] - 2023-05-31

### Added

- Added `Store::pretrained_model` function to retrieve pre-trained models based
  on their names. This function allows users to retrieve a pre-trained model
  from the store by specifying its name. When called, the function returns a
  `PretrainedModel` struct, defined as `pub struct PretrainedModel(pub Vec<u8>)`.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-05-26

### Added

- New functions in `backup`:
  - `list`: This function retrieves the details of backups stored on the file
  system and returns a vector of `BackupInfo` instances. Each `BackupInfo`
  instance contains details such as the backup's ID, creation timestamp, and
  size.
  - `restore`: This function enables the restoration of backups using their ID.
  Users can restore their data from a specific backup by providing the `Store`
  instance and the backup ID.

### Fixed

- Corrected an issue in the `migrate_0_9_to_0_11` function in the
  review-database. The function was incorrectly updating `HttpThreatFields` to
  its latest (0.12) version instead of the intended 0.11 version, causing
  inconsistencies when `migrate_0_11_to_0_12` was subsequently applied. This
  has been resolved by introducing a new struct `NewHttpThreatFields` that
  correctly represents the `HttpThreatFields` structure at version 0.11. The
  function now deserializes the old fields into `OldHttpThreatFields`, converts
  it into `NewHttpThreatFields` (i.e., the 0.11 version), and then stores its
  serialized form back into the database. This ensures that each migration
  function behaves as expected and applies the correct changes respective to
  its version.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-05-25

### Added

- `backup::create`: This new function creates a new RocksDB backup. In a future
  release, this function will be enhanced to support creation of PostgreSQL
  backups as well. This provides a centralized and consistent interface for
  creating backups across different types of databases.
- New functions in `Store`:
  - `Store::get_backup_info`: This new function retrieves the details of
    backups stored on filesystem. The returned information is in the form of
    `Vec<BackupEngineInfo>`. Each `BackupEngineInfo` instance contains details
    like backup's timestamp, ID, size, and number of files. This will help
    users to get detailed insights about each backup available on the
    filesystem.
  - `Store::restore_from_backup`: This new function allows users to restore
    from a specific backup, given a backup ID. The feature adds significant
    utility to the users by enabling them to restore data from the selected
    backup easily and quickly.

### Changed

- The `backup` function has been renamed to `backup::schedule_periodic` for
  better clarity and to more accurately represent its functionality of
  initiating periodic backups. Please update any references in your codebase
  accordingly.

### Removed

- `Store::backup` has been removed from our API. It is replaced by the
  `backup::create` function to streamline and centralize backup operations.
  Please update your codebase to call `backup::create` for creating database
  backups.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-05-22

### Changed

- Removed `policy` field from `DataSource`. This change has been made to
  streamline the information flow and reduce redundancy in the data structure.
  If you were previously relying on this field, use `source` field instead.
- Added confidence field to `DgaFields`. This addition aims to provide a
  numeric measure of the reliability of DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)
  detections, helping to make more informed decisions on potential threats.
- Changed the storage format for the time field in `HttpThreatFields`.
  Previously, the time field was stored as a `DateTime<Utc>`, but it's now
  being stored as nanoseconds in `i64`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where an "invalid event" was incorrectly logged to syslog for DGA
  events.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-05-18

### Changed

- The `HttpThreat` event object has been significantly expanded to incorporate
  all its original fields.
- Added a new field called matched_to to the `HttpThreat` event object. This
  field will contain the patterns that have been matched, enabling users to
  identify the threats they are exposed to more effectively.

## [0.10.1] - 2023-05-16

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `event_source` column becomes `null` when the value
  of `max_event_id_num` gets updated.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-05-16

### Changed

- Improved security by hiding `SaltedPassword`, `Account::password` field and
  related operations from user access.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-05-15

### Added

- Introduced a new iterator method, `Table<Account>::iter`, to enhance the
  encapsulation of the internal database serialization format and improve
  usability. This method returns an iterator that generates `Account` objects
  in each iteration, simplifying the use of iterators and mitigating potential
  issues associated with the direct manipulation of serialized data.
- Expanded the `DnsCovertChannel` and `TorConnection` events by adding all
  fields. These added fields enable packet attribute criteria to be performed
  during the adjudication function.
- Added support for argon2id as a password hashing algorithm.

### Changed

- Revised the
  `Event::DomainGenerationAlgorithm(Box<DomainGenerationAlgorithm>)` variant to
  `Event::DomainGenerationAlgorithm(DomainGenerationAlgorithm)`. This change
  enhances the code structure and reduces unnecessary memory allocations.

### Deprecated

- The methods `Table<Account>::iter_forward`, `Table<Account>::iter_backward`,
  and `Table<Account>::iter_from` have been deprecated. These methods will be
  removed in a future release. We encourage developers to transition to the new
  `Table<Account>::iter` method for iterating over `Account` objects in the
  database. The deprecated methods expose the internal, serialized form in the
  database as `[u8]`, which can create potential challenges in data handling.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-05-08

### Added

- Introduced a new column 'classification_id' in the 'model' table to track the
  timestamp of the latest model classification.

### Changed

- `Table<Account>::put` and `Table<Account>::insert` allow adding an Account
  instance directly to the database, without requiring explicit serialization
  by the caller.
- Renamed `Table<Account>::update_account` to `Table<Account>::update`. This
  change simplifies the method name and provides a more consistent interface
  for updating `Account` records.
- Introduced `event_sources` for `Cluster` to properly identify events included
  in the cluster.

### Removed

- Removed the old `Table<Account>::update` method. This method was exposing the
  internal format of the database to the public API, which could lead to
  potential security and compatibility issues. To maintain a secure and
  reliable interface, we have decided to remove this method. Users should now
  use the newly renamed `Table<Account>::update` method for updating `Account`
  records.

### Fixed

- Resolved issue with 'load_outliers' function to accurately retrieve cluster data.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-05-03

### Fixed

- Fixed query for selecting column description.
- Fixed a case where the migration process was not correctly handling existing
  empty values in the event_ids column.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-05-02

### Changed

- Updated `ip2location` to 0.4.2.
- Updated the database to include event_source(s) and modified the relevant
  queries to accommodate this change.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-04-26

### Changed

- Add `port/protocol` to `TrafficFilterRules` to filter traffic in Piglet

## [0.5.0] - 2023-04-24

### Changed

- The return value of `Store::account_map` method has been modified to provide
  better encapsulation and prevent misuse of account-related functions.
  Previously, this method returned a `Map` object, which allowed direct access
  to the underlying data structure. To ensure that account-related functions
  are only called on relevant objects, we have updated the return value to be
  `Table<Account>` instead. As part of this change, the `Map::update_account`
  function has been moved to `Table<Account>`. This helps prevent other Map
  objects that have nothing to do with Account from mistakenly calling the
  update_account function. This change aims to promote better practices in
  accessing and manipulating the account data, as well as providing a more
  consistent API for developers.
- `sensors`, `confidence`, and `learning_methods` are added in `EventFilter`.

### Removed

- `StatdDb` and `Map::new`. They are only used internally and shouldn't be
  called from another crate.
- `Map::update_account`. Use `Table<Account>::update_account` instead.
- `BlockingPgPool` has been removed as `diesel_async` is used instead.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-04-06

### Added

- Add `PrefixMap` to provide prefix iterating.

### Changed

- Update interface to interact with outlier map.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-03-30

### Added

- Support for Argon2id as a new and more secure alternative to the existing
  PBKDF2 password hashing algorithm.
- Add `distance` field for `UpdateOutlierRequest`.
- Add migration support for database.

### Removed

- `initial_account` has been removed since it should be defined by the
  application.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-03-22

### Changed

- `DataSource` is updated to store additional properties.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-03-20

### Added

- An initial version.
